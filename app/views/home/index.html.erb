  Agorium is a decentralized, zero-commission, no-subscription-fee marketplace designed for small retailers in India. Traditional ecommerce marketplaces today gobble up most of the value they create – in the form of margins, customer relationship, and data – making small sellers 'second-class citizens' in the process. It really doesn't have to be this way. Agorium is focused on flipping this model over its head. We've managed to design an open platform model that provides most of the value to the retailers themselves, and we're currently working hard on building it well. We're calling it Agorium because this concept is built upon the core value of <i><%= link_to 'Agora markets', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora' %></i> of the ancient Greek city-states, viz. giving the power to sell freely to the small businesses. <%= link_to 'Sign up', signup_path, class: 'has-text-primary' %> to become an early user.

          Agorium does not create a wall between you and your customers. In fact we've designed specific features for you to establish long-term relationships with your buyers, just like the good old days of in-person retail.

          It's true, we don't take any cut from your sales. This is part of our mission to allow sellers to trade freely, and to not monopolize the value that gets created on the platform. Our business model is similar to Mozilla or Wikimedia Foundation.

          We put a lot of love and effort in making Agorium's interface simple, beautifully designed and fun-to-use. Our side-mission is to design software that makes our users smile when they interact with it.
