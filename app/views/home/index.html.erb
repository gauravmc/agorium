          Why we started Agorium
        </p>
        <p class="subtitle is-4 has-text-grey">
          Traditional ecommerce marketplaces today gobble up most of the value they create – in the form of margins, customer relationship, and data – making small sellers 'second-class citizens' in the process. It really doesn't have to be this way. Agorium is focused on flipping this model over its head. We've managed to design an open platform model that provides most of the value to the retailers themselves, taking only a tiny amount in return. We're calling it Agorium because this concept is built upon the core value of <i><%= link_to 'Agora markets', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora' %></i> of the ancient Greek city-states, viz. giving the power to sell freely to the small businesses.
